😡🤬 What on earth just happened, Github?! 😡 My code was working perfectly fine, and now it's BROKEN! 💔 Who gave you the audacity to sabotage my hard work like this?! 😤

👿👊 I poured my heart and soul into that code, only for you to come along and mess it up! It was working flawlessly, and now it's a DISASTER! 🚨 Do you even know how much time and effort I invested in this project? Apparently not, since you seem to have NO REGARD for my dedication and passion! 🔥

💢 This is not some game to be played with, Github! I trusted you to keep my code SAFE and SECURE, but instead, you've turned it into a trainwreck! 😠 You better fix this IMMEDIATELY and make it right, or there will be CONSEQUENCES! 💢

🔨👹 I won't rest until my code is RESTORED to its former glory. You've pushed me to my limit, Github, and now you're going to feel the full force of my WRATH! Prepare yourself for the storm of fury that's coming your way! 🌪️⚡

😡💻 Consider yourself warned, Github. This is not over until my code is FIXED and functioning as it should. Don't you dare underestimate the power of a DEVASTATED developer! 🔥🔥🔥
